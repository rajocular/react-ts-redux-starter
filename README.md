# React Starter
A complete react starter template using Typescript, Redux and Webpack

## Description

To get started quickly, there are some components available in the `Components` directory.


For only the barebones
of the boilerplate, check out my [react-ts-boileplate](https://github.com/rajocular/react-ts-boilerplate) repo

## Available Scripts

### start

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

```
npm run start
```

### start:log

Runs the app in the developer logger mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

You will also see redux logs in the console.

```
npm run start:log
```

### build

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

```
npm run build
```

### serve

Runs the application based off the build directory. It mocks the behaviour of how the application
would run in production.

```
npm run serve
```

### lint

Lints through the application and fix warnings on its own based on the rules defined in the tslint.json file.

```
npm run lint
```
